This repository is created as a backup for a video series I created on Youtube on the topic of getting a vanilla kernel to work on the beaglebone black with GPU support, the readme files aren't complete and I'll keep modifying them to get to a none-embarrassing state. In the meantime, it's better to follow the video series until I find the time to fix and add more details to this repository.
